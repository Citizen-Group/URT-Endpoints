# Getting your own GeoReports server
**Citizen** provides a low cost, non-profit service, to assist less technically minded groups and organizations to digitalize their desire for social good. 

## Backround
At the heart of the **Citizen Reporting Ecosystem** is _Citizen's Universal Reporting Tool_. It is powered by some fancy code and system of established protocol, locations and words. In the technical realm, we refer to this as an API (an application program interface). 

The reason APIs are created and used, is that they establish in a concise manner, the rules, words and results that an application will/must take. As a developer, you can then trust and expect that all other developers, who use the API, will have the same results and structure as defined by the API. This allows you to rely on them, and them on you, without having to understand the details and the custom aspects of their projects.

The API the **URT** and the **Citizen Reporting Ecosystem** uses is called **GeoReports V2**. Its a well established, small and lightweight API, that defines a logical way of allowing machine to accept service requests via Web URLs and specifies the behavior that automated machines should expect when talking to those web URLs.

The **URT** is advanced tool that provides an advanced multi endpoint routing, validation and determination service, alongside a host of service quality and service accountability features, like:
- Service request verification
- Subscriber feeds
- Auto escalation of service requests
- Status monitoring with email notifications

While these features are provided though the **URT** to your clients. They require a **URT** compliant or **GeoReports V2** compliant server to be running for them to work properly. Without a compliant server, the automated systems cannot expect or trust, or receive the responses it is looking for.

As a result, **Citizen** provides a non-profit service, to assist less technically minded groups and organizations to digitalize their desire for social good. 

We can provide assistance in:
- Creating and self-hosting your own GeoReports API server
- Cloud hosting your own GeoReports API server on Amazon Web Services
- Configuring your own GeoReports API server

And services to:
- Have us configure and host your own **independent** GeoReports API server running on a Amazon Web Services Server
- Have us configure, host and manage a GeoReports API server running on a **shared** Amazon Web Services Server
- Provide technical work to link the GeoReports API server's output to existing systems in your organization

## Getting your own GeoReports server
If you do not have the technical skill, have high usage demands, or have legal requirements that force you to store your data locally. We recommend to have us configure and manage your Endpoint on a **shared server**. **Our management is mandatory for legal, privacy and security reasons, due to it being a shared server**

What this means, is that we would configure and place your Endpoint/GeoReports Server alongside other report servers which are all doing the same thing (because of the API). Using a special identifier we separate your traffic from others and route it to where it need to go.

This approach limits a bit of customization, but for the majorly of service providers - aside for government agencies, commissions, NGO and other large organizations with big volume, this will be an acceptable fit.

If you do have the technical skill, take a look at the https://wiki.open311.org/GeoReport_v2/ website.

A list of server providers is also listed here: https://wiki.open311.org/GeoReport_v2/Resources/

**Citizen** will eventually be also publicly providing a *one click run* Node/JS GeoReports v2 server. Currently this project is restricted to managed clients. Currently the code is too complex and requires simplification and more documentation to make it fit for mainstream public use.
